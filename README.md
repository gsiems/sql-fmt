A somewhat opinionated SQL formatter.

## Goals

* To not break anything.

* To format DML for various DBMS dialects with a primary focus on PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Oracle.

* To format basic DDL.

* To format PostgreSQL functions and procedures where the language is either plpgsql or sql.

* To format Oracle functions, procedures, and packages (PL/SQL).
