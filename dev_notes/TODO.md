## Dialects

* consider how to identify the size/precision/scale of a datatype as being part
of the datatype

## Parser

* consider how to flag the size/precision/scale of a datatype as being part of
the datatype

## Tagging

Still need to tag:

* Oracle package, function, and procedure code
* DDL code

## Formatting

* Since this is intended to format code the way that "I" prefer to see/use it,
then there may be some benefit to including a style guide that documents and
explains my preferences.
